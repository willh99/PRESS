# PRESS
Price Reactive Energy Storage System User Interface from Netbeans

This is the user application for the Price Reactive Energy Storage System (PRESS).
This application, when finished, will be capable of connecting to an embedded device (currently a RaspberryPi) which 
controls an Inverter capabile of buying and selling energy to the grid intellegently based on price. Additionally,
the user application will be able to periodically pull princing data from the Internet when connected, show the user data
relevant to the operation of the PRESS system, and manually override the operating status of the embedded device.

The PRESS UI is currently being coded in Java NetBeans in order to take advantage of the ease with which Java Swing GUI toolkit
can be created in the IDE. This may be subject to change at a latter point.
